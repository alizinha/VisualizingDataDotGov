# VisualizingDataDotGov

Solo assignment creating an app that visualizes open-source NYC government data using a JSON dataset, fetching and parsing the data in real time through a network connection. Also created a daily notification pop-up, displayed the data using an adapter, and varied the threading model (switching from Async Task to Retrofit).
